This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) project bootstrapped using Portable's [Easey](https://github.com/PortableStudios/easey) generator.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create your .env file

Generate an `.env` file from the template and fill in the details as necessary:

```
cp .env.local.example .env
```

### 2. Start developing

Ensure you are using the correct Node version via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md):

```bash
nvm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

### 3. Open Storybook (optional)

While developing you may also want to run Storybook:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view your component library.

## Generating theme from Figma file

If the project Figma file was created from the [Portable UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/m1rARkfdPU6dB7n9ofBRHw/Portable-UI-Kit) template
you can use our [`figma2theme`](https://github.com/PortableStudios/figma2theme) tool to generate a Chakra UI theme.

First, create a `.figma2themerc` file in your project containing the
Figma file URL, here's an example using the URL of our Figma template:

```json
{
  "fileUrl": "https://www.figma.com/design/b6tcOWalyHLDfsD0IBSXyE/Portable-UI-Kit-v2"
}
```

Now add your Figma API key to the `.env` file of your project.
A key can be generated under the 'Personal Access Tokens' section of the Figma settings.

```
FIGMA_API_KEY=
```

Now run the following command:

```bash
yarn update-theme
```

This will generate a Chakra UI theme and save the file(s) to `./src/theme/_generated`.

Finally, update the `/src/theme/theme.ts` file so that it imports
your newly generated theme rather than the default Chakra UI theme.

Default theme provided by Chakra UI (old):

```javascript
import { theme } from '@chakra-ui/react';
```

Custom theme generated by figma2theme (new):

```javascript
import theme from '@/theme/_generated';
```

Once you make this swap your projects theme should now be based on the theme
generated by figma2theme rather than the default theme provided by Chakra UI.

Now is a good time to open Storybook and view the "Theme/Foundations"
stories to check that your tokens are being loaded successfully.

If the Figma project includes layout grid styles, the script will also generate a
`grids.ts` file which will contain "grid config" objects corresponding to each style.

## Code Generation

[Plop](https://plopjs.com/) is included in this project to allow us to quickly generate code.

```bash
yarn plop
```

Currently the available options are:

- A React component, with a Storybook story and a Jest test
- A Next.js page, with a Cypress test

The config for this tool can be found in `plopfile.js` and
the templates can be found in the `/templates` folder.
