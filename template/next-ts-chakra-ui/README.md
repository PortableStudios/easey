# <%= meta.name %>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) project bootstrapped with Portable's [`easey`](https://github.com/PortableStudios/sao-easey) generator.

## Getting Started

First, create an `.env` file with the following contents:

```
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Now, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

While developing you may also want to run Storybook:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to view your UI library.

## Code Generation

[Plop](https://plopjs.com/) is included in this project to allow us to quickly generate code.

```bash
yarn plop
```

Currently the available options are:

- A React component, with a Storybook story and a Jest test
- A Next.js page, with a Cypress test

The config for this tool can be found in `plopfile.js` and
the templates can be found in the `/templates` folder.
