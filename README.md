# Easey üè≠

Based on Lee Briggs' [`deja-dev`](https://github.com/theleebriggs/deja-dev),
the purpose of this scaffolding tool is to enable us to painlessly skip the
boilerplate and start working on the real meat of our projects as soon as possible.

Built using the [SAO](https://github.com/saojs/sao) framework.

## Stacks

## Usage

Generate your project using the following command:

```bash
npx sao PortableStudios/easey#main -u <project-folder>
```

Now install the dependencies and create your initial commit:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
nvm install
yarn install
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit generated by Easey scaffolding tool"
```

## Development

You can test the tool locally by running the following command from the parent directory:

```bash
npx sao ./easey -u <project-folder>
```

The easiest way to make changes to the templates while testing
them is running the following commands from the parent directory:

```bash
npx sao ./easey -u <project-folder>
cd <project-folder>
nvm install
yarn install
git add .
git commit -am "Initial commit"
```

Now any changes you make to the project can be viewed
in Git and copied back to the template after testing.
